For the following requirements we need to screenshot a answer. No text possible but a screenshot per requirement.

1. The System shall allow access to historic and archived data and retrieval of data for a specific date and also for a time period. All database-stored information shall be retained for a minimum number of years as defined in the Data Protection policy for the purposes of audit and data analysis. Retention period to be configurable.
--> second part of this requirement I don't know how to proove. Is there a setting in the system per se which could be screenshotted here as response?

2. The System shall retain all audit logs for a period of 180 days. Retention period to be configurable.
--> screenshot needed

3. The System shall allow a review of the events of a Vehicles activity (location/time/boarding/alighting) to assist with any incident analysis. For example, investigation of complaints. Retention period to be configurable .
--> investigation of complaints + retention period to be configurable unclear where to find a screenshot


4. The System shall provide the functionality to configure new and update existing fare types.
-_> screenshot where you configure payment would be highly appreciated since I dont know how to do that on demo

5. Distance fares to include a boarding charge plus "as the crow flies" add-ons which results in an aggregate charge, e.g. boarding charge is €1. Every additional 20km is 50c so a Trip with a distance of 60km would cost € 2.50. All component charges to be configurable.

6. Time based, e.g. based on the duration of the Trip;  
--> is this possible regarding payment?

7. Flat rate – same charge regardless of distance; 
--> price matrix setup

8. “Vulnerable person” rate  -can be used at the discretion of the Driver to allow a Passenger identified as “vulnerable” to board at a nominal fee and record the Passenger for capacity and tracking purposes; 

9. Ability to charge a premium, e.g. for door to door pick-ups , night time SDRT Service; 
--> is this possible?

10. The System shall enable the ability to add and remove/disable payment methods at System level. 

thanks!
